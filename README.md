# Webpack config for React
A ready setup configuration of Webpack for React development
using Babel as transpiler.

## Get started
First, you need to install the dependencies, devDependencies and
direct dependencies, with:
```
npm install
```
Then, you could check it with `npm start`

## How to use it?
It's like a create-react-app script (at least to development
and build), but more simple to understand!.
Only start to write code into src folder how you've been doing.

## About the packages
- Webpack
It's the main package. This manages and read our files for
compile in simple static files ready to unfold.
- Babel, babel presets
Babel will be our transpiler of our code to convert it to a
kind of javascript that all browsers (at least the majority) can
understand, because don't all features of js (ES6+) are supported.
- Corejs
Core js is a modular library for JS, inclues polyfill for ES10+
that it allows us to use the last features of ECMAScript in older or 
unsupported browsers about those features.
